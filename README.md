# Optical Power Meter FOPM-203/204 Communication and Data Processing Framework

This repository contains a Python-based framework designed to facilitate communication with the [optical power meter by FS.com](https://www.fs.com/de-en/products/97490.html?attribute=25333&id=471143) and process the data it provides. It employs a strategy pattern to dynamically load and apply data processing algorithms based on the received data, ensuring extensibility and modularity.

## This open source project does not have any connection to FS.com and therefore no support at all. Use at own risk. 
Also, thank you FS.com for letting us publish this Project as an open source project.

## Features

- Dynamic loading of data processing strategies.
- `async` data receiving in backgroundthread
- Communication with devices via serial port.
- Auto-connect with device finding mechanism
- Processing of optical power, wavelength, and battery level data.
- Console commands are prepared to control the device using console if wanted
- Extensible architecture to add more data processing strategies.

## Supported Commands
- RETURN_POWER_ADC_FREQUENCY
- RETURN_POWER_WAVELENGTH_BATTERY
- RETURN_POWER_REFERENCE_POWER
- SWITCH_WAVELENGTH_GEAR_AND_READ_REFERENCE_POWER 
- SWITCH_WAVELENGTH_GEAR_DIRECTLY
- SWITCH_OPTICAL_POWER_UNIT_TO_UW 
- SWITCH_OPTICAL_POWER_UNIT_TO_DBM
- SWITCH_TO_VIEW_REFERENCE_VALUE_MODE
- SET_CURRENT_OPTICAL_POWER_AS_REFERENCE
- SWITCH_LED_BACKLIGHT
- TURN_ON_LED_BACKLIGHT
- TURN_OFF_LED_BACKLIGHT
- AUTO_POWER_OFF
- AUTOMATIC_SHUTDOWN_ON
- RESET_OPTICAL_POWER_REFERENCE_VALUE
- DELETE_ALL_RECORDS_OF_EEPROM
- READ_THE_VALUE_OF_CORRESPONDING_ADDRESS_OF_EEPROM (not fully implemented)
- RETURNS_THE_NUMBER_OF_STORED_POWER_RECORDS (not fully implemented)
- CLEAR_STORED_POWER_RECORDS

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- `pyserial==3.5` library installed.

## example Code
``` python
import asyncio
from commands import Commands
from device_controller import DeviceController

# create a controller and connect to the device
async def main():
    async with DeviceController(connectionTimeout=60) as controller:
        while True:
            # ask the power meter to send us the power
            controller.send_command(Commands.RETURN_POWER_WAVELENGTH_BATTERY)
            # wait until the response is there
            await controller.wait_for_power_data_change_async()
            print(f"power: {controller.optical_power} \t Œª: {controller.wavelength} \tüîã {controller.battery_level} \t")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### background thread
the power meter controller also supports a background thread that observes all data from the power meter automatically so that you simply have to use them directly or you can let it print the data for you

```python
import asyncio
from commands import Commands
from console_helper import async_input, handle_console
from device_controller import DeviceController

# create a controller and connect to the device
async def main():
    async with DeviceController(connectionTimeout=60) as controller:
        # start powermeter controller in background thread
        controller.start_update_in_background()
        print("welcome. print 'help' for a quick command reference")

        while True:
            # handles the console input like 'help' or 'start' and 'stop'
            input = await async_input()

            if (input == "start"):
                print("start printing data. enter 'stop' to abort.")
                await asyncio.sleep(0.2)
                # the controller is always getting the data from the powermeter as fast as possible (around 8 times per second)
                # setting 'do_print_data' makes the controller print its power data automatically
                controller.do_print_data = True
                # print( controller.optical_power + " in micro Watts")
            elif (input == "stop"):
                controller.do_print_data = False
            await asyncio.sleep(0.01)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Akhetonics/PowerMeterLibrary.git
```

## Troubleshooting

- *Device Not Found:* Ensure your device is properly connected - the cable often falls out - and the correct port (usually com3) is available. Try reconnecting your device or restarting the script. (often you might have multiple instances of the script running which will block the serial port.)
- *Data Processing Issues:* Verify that your data processing strategies are correctly implemented and can handle the data formats sent by your device. -> not all commands'es responses are implemented, but most are. just add a class into the DataProcessing folder and strucutre it similar like the others. make sure the identifying two numbers are defined properly.

## Usage

To start using this framework, perform the following steps:

1. Ensure your device is connected to the computer.
2. Run the main script to start the communication and data processing:
